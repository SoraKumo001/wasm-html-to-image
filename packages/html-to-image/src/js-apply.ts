 * URL. Preloading images here would fetch them a second time in the render, and would spend the script
 * timeout on bytes the render fetches anyway, so none is done.
 *
 * The timing therefore reaches the page only while a render runs with the DOM still open
 * (`measureLayout()` does this). `applyScripted` serializes the page and closes the DOM, so an
 * `img.decode()` awaited by a script cannot observe the renderer's fetch; the records start at the render.
 *
 * `<link rel=stylesheet>` is the one resource the script phase does fetch (so `getComputedStyle` sees the
 * cascade while the scripts run); the render fetches that sheet again. Images get no such pre-pass: one
 * fetch in the render is the whole policy.
