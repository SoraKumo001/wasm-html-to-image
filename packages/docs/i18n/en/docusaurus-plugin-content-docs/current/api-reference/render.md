# render() & Options Reference

`render()` is the primary function for converting HTML or raw images into the target format.

## Signatures

```typescript
// wasm-html-to-image/single
export function render(
  options: HtmlToImageOptions,
): Promise<Uint8Array | string>;

// wasm-html-to-image
export function htmlToImage(
  module: HtmlToImageModule,
  options: HtmlToImageOptions,
): Promise<Uint8Array | string>;
```

:::note Return Type
Returns a `string` for `svg` format, and `Uint8Array` for all other formats (`png`, `jpeg`, `webp`, `apng`, `gif`, `tiff`, `avif`, `jxl`, `pdf`, `raw`, `thumbhash`).

## Options (`HtmlToImageOptions`)

### Core Options

| Option    | Type                                              |   Default    | Description                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- | :----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `value`   | `string \| string[] \| Uint8Array \| ArrayBuffer` |      -       | Input data (HTML string, HTML array for multi-page PDF, or image buffer) |
| `url`     | `string`                                          |      -       | URL to fetch and render when `value` is omitted                          |
| `baseUrl` | `string`                                          |      -       | Base URL for resolving relative assets                                   |
| `width`   | `number`                                          |    `800`     | Viewport width (HTML) or target output width (image)                     |
| `height`  | `number`                                          |    `auto`    | Viewport height (HTML) or target output height (image)                   |
| `format`  | `OutputFormat`                                    |   `"png"`    | Target output format (`png`, `jpeg`, `webp`, `apng`, `gif`, `tiff`, `avif`, `jxl`, `raw`, `thumbhash`, `svg`, `pdf`) |
| `scale` | `number` | `1` | Pixel density of raster output from HTML input (0-16). `width` stays in CSS px and the page is drawn `scale` times larger (`scale: 3.125` turns an 800px layout into a 2500px image, with text and shapes re-rasterized rather than stretched). Ignored for `svg` / `pdf` and for image input. |
| `dpi` | `number` | `96 × scale` | Resolution written to `tiff`, in pixels per inch. A print shop reads the physical size from it. |
| `colorSpace` | `"srgb" \| "cmyk"` | `"srgb"` | Output color space of `tiff` and `pdf`. `"cmyk"` is for print: TIFF becomes a separated CMYK image with transparency flattened onto white, and PDF has every fill, stroke and image rewritten to DeviceCMYK. The conversion is the plain device formula (K = 1 − max(R,G,B), black stays K only) with no ICC profile, so saturated screen colors are not gamut-mapped. Ignored for other formats. |

### Encoding & Resizing

| Option      | Type                                                      | Default | Description                                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | :-----: | -------------------------------------------- |
| `quality`   | `number`                                                  |  `85`   | Compression quality 0–100 (JPEG, WebP, AVIF) |
| `speed`     | `number`                                                  | AVIF: `8` / other: `6` | Encoding speed 0–10 (AVIF, JXL, PNG and animated lossy WebP). PNG uses zlib level `12 - speed` (the default 6 is level 6, output unchanged; 9 is level 3: about 20% faster on a large page, ~15% larger files). Animated WebP uses libwebp method `8 - speed`: the default 6 is method 2, 5 is method 3 (~4% smaller), 9 is method 0 (fastest, ~30% larger). AVIF at 8 is several times faster than 6 for ~15–20% larger files; pass `speed: 6` for the smallest output |
| `fit`       | `"contain" \| "cover" \| "fill"`                          |    -    | Resize fit strategy                          |
| `crop`      | `{ x: number, y: number, width: number, height: number }` |    -    | Cropping bounding rectangle                  |
| `animation` | `boolean \| { duration: number; fps?: number; loop?: number }` | `false` | Preserve animation frames where supported. For HTML input, `{ duration, fps, loop }` samples `opacity`, `transform` (`translate` / `rotate` / `scale`), and `color` / `background-color` `@keyframes` into an animated WebP / APNG / GIF (`format: "webp" | "apng" | "gif"`); every `@keyframes` block animates all the elements its rule selects (several animations on one element are layered); `loop` is the repeat count (`0` = infinite = the default, `1` = play once). CSS `animation-duration` (including the shorthand) takes precedence, with `duration` used as an upper clamp and `fps` as the sampling rate |

### Fonts & Styling

| Option          | Type                                      |      Default       | Description                                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | :----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fontMap`       | `Record<string, string>`                  | `DEFAULT_FONT_MAP` | Map of generic family names to Google Fonts URLs       |
| `fallbackFonts` | `(Uint8Array \| ArrayBuffer \| string \| { source, unicodeRange? })[]` |        `[]`        | User-supplied fallback fonts (bytes, data URL, URL, or `{ source, unicodeRange }` for on-demand loading) |
| `fonts`         | `{ name: string, data: Uint8Array }[]`    |        `[]`        | Named fonts pre-loaded on the instance                 |
| `css`           | `string`                                  |         -          | Additional custom CSS string injected before discovery |
| `mediaType`     | `"screen" \| "print"`                     |     `"screen"`     | Target media type for CSS `@media` rules               |
| `textToPaths`   | `boolean`                                 |       `true`       | Outline text as SVG paths                              |
| `userAgent`     | `string`                                  |  Chrome's UA       | User-Agent for resource fetches (Web font CSS, ...)    |

### Running scripts (`javascript`) and Mermaid (`mermaid`)

| Option | Type | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| `javascript` | `boolean \| { timeout?: number, settleMs?: number, waitFor?: string, engine?: "quickjs", limits?, skip? }` | Run the page's `<script>`s in QuickJS (WebAssembly) on a DOM written in C before rendering (the Node.js `single` entry and the CLI's `--js` do it for you; on edge entries, call `applyJavaScript()` first). `true` waits 1 s after `load`. `timeout` bounds the whole phase (default 10000 ms; `0` / `Infinity` disables the limit), `settleMs` is the wait after `load` (default 1000 ms), `waitFor` is a CSS selector to wait for (replaces `settleMs`). `engine` accepts only `"quickjs"` (kept for one release; `"jsdom"` throws at runtime) — there is no other engine. `limits` / `skip` bound what the page may fetch. There is no layout and no sandbox: use it with trusted pages only |
| `mermaid` | `{ source, theme?, padding?, background?, accent?, mode?, directives?, onWarning?, maxLines?, maxSourceBytes? }` | Draw a Mermaid diagram (instead of `value`), as an image sized to the diagram. See [Mermaid conversion](./mermaid.md) |

#### Running scripts on edge runtimes (Cloudflare Workers and others)

The QuickJS (WebAssembly) engine runs on every runtime. Where `eval` is not allowed, such as Workers, `applyJavaScript()` from `wasm-html-to-image/javascript` runs the page's scripts in QuickJS on a DOM written in C. A React / Next.js client has been checked to run through hydration and its `useEffect`s.

```ts
import { applyJavaScript } from "wasm-html-to-image/javascript";
import { render } from "wasm-html-to-image/workerd";

const options = await applyJavaScript({ url: "https://example.com/", javascript: true, width: 1200, format: "png" });
const { data } = await render(options);
```

- The package picks the QuickJS wasm for the runtime (`#quickjs-wasm` in the `imports` of `package.json`): a pre-compiled module on Workers and on Vercel / Next.js Edge, read from disk on Node.js and Bun, fetched on Deno and in browsers. To use a module of your own, pass it as `applyJavaScript(options, { quickjsWasm })`. The Node.js `single` entry and the CLI's `--js` run the same phase for you.
- The engine itself is the separate package [`wasm-quickjs-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wasm-quickjs-dom) (a small DOM implementation that knows nothing about images), installed as a dependency of `wasm-html-to-image`. `createDOM` can also be used straight from `wasm-quickjs-dom`.
- The Node.js `single` entry's `runPageScripts` is now an alias of `wasm-quickjs-dom`'s `runPageScriptsQuickJS`. Its third argument `viewportWidth` defaults to `undefined` (the options' `width` is used, then 800) instead of 800, so `matchMedia` can answer differently than before.
- Limits: no layout of its own (`getBoundingClientRect` returns 0 until `measureLayout()` or `enableLiveLayout()` supplies boxes; see below), no `canvas`, `type="module"` scripts run, but only `import`s with literal specifiers (fetched up front) resolve. The DOM is a small one written in C, and QuickJS is an interpreter, so heavy pages are slower.
- More limits: `attachShadow()` works, but `serialize()` and the rendered HTML leave shadow trees out (a warning is logged when a root is attached). `document.fonts` is a stub (`ready` resolves at once, `check()` is always `true`, `load()` resolves to an empty array) and `FontFace` does not exist. Interaction pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, `:visited`, `:target`, `:focus-within`, `:focus-visible`) and pseudo-elements never match, in selectors or in `getComputedStyle()` (`matchMedia("(hover: hover)")` still reports `true`). `document.elementFromPoint()` returns `null` and `elementsFromPoint()` returns `[]`; `scroll()`, `scrollTo()`, `scrollBy()`, and `scrollIntoView()` do nothing (`scrollTop` / `scrollLeft` read `0`). An `<iframe>`'s `contentWindow` / `contentDocument` are `null`, and `srcdoc` is kept as an attribute only, never loaded. XPath cannot resolve namespace prefixes (`namespace-uri()` is `""`, `createNSResolver()` returns `null`). `crypto.getRandomValues()` / `crypto.randomUUID()` are built on `Math.random`, so they are not cryptographically secure. Canvas `getContext()` returns `null` (and `toDataURL()` `"data:,"`), so calling a method on the context throws a `TypeError`. SVG `getBBox()` / `getTotalLength()` / `getPointAtLength()` are approximate: a path's `A` command is its chord, `transform`s are ignored, and `<text>` is `0 × 0`.
- Use it with trusted pages only (the scripts can `fetch`). For pages you do not control, always add the fetch limits below, or `javascript: { limits, skip }`.
- `IntersectionObserver` and `ResizeObserver` report once when you `observe()` (the page is meant to be seen whole, without scrolling, so everything counts as intersecting and lazy content gets to load). `matchMedia` answers for the viewport `width` (`min-width` / `max-width` / `orientation` ..., with a light-mode, no-motion user). `getComputedStyle` computes the cascade of `<style>` and the element's own `style`, inheritance and initial values, but does not lay out: a `width` / `height` of `auto` or `%` comes back as written (`auto`, `50%`, ...), so take real sizes from the boxes `measureLayout()` returns.

#### Keeping the DOM open (`createDOM`)

Without rendering anything, the page can be kept open and driven, like a browser page. The DOM lives inside QuickJS, so you talk to it through `eval()` and JSON values rather than a live `dom.window`.

```ts
import { createDOM } from "wasm-html-to-image/javascript";
import { render } from "wasm-html-to-image/workerd";

const dom = await createDOM({ url: "https://example.com/" }, { width: 1200 });
try {
  const title = await dom.eval("document.title");            // the value comes back as JSON; promises are awaited
  await dom.eval("document.querySelector('h1').textContent = 'Hello'");
  const { data } = await render(dom.toOptions({ width: 1200, format: "png" })); // draw the DOM as it is now
} finally {
  dom.close();                                                // frees QuickJS
}
```

- `eval(fn, ...args)` also takes a function and JSON arguments (`dom.eval((sel) => document.querySelectorAll(sel).length, "a")`). The function travels as source text, so it cannot use variables from its surroundings.
- `click(selector)`, `type(selector, text)` (sets `value`, fires `input` and `change`) and `waitForSelector(selector)` drive the page and wait for it. They return `false` when nothing matched.
- `expose(name, fn)` makes a host function callable from the page as `await window[name](...args)`. Arguments and result travel as JSON; a throw becomes a rejection with the same message.
- `eval(code)` runs code in the page's global scope and returns the result as JSON. A promise is awaited, and what the code throws becomes an `Error`. A DOM node cannot be returned: return what you read from it. Calls run one after another.
- `settle(ms?)` lets the page's timers and fetches run. The page's clock runs only during `eval()` / `settle()`, not in between.
- `serialize()` is the current HTML; `toOptions(options)` gives render options you can pass to `render()` as they are.
- The second argument of `createDOM` is the `javascript` option (`timeout` / `settleMs` / `waitFor`) plus `width` and `quickjsWasm`. `timeout` counts per call.
- `bridge()` gives the host synchronous access to the page's DOM (each property read, write or method call is one call into QuickJS; the same node is always the same wrapper).

**Moving from jsdom**: the DOM lives inside QuickJS, so there is no `window` to hand around. Values cross the boundary as JSON, so `dom.eval(fn, ...args)` returns only what JSON can carry (no DOM nodes), and a function travels as source text, so it cannot close over outer variables. Give the page host functions with `dom.expose(name, fn)` (`await window[name](...args)`), and use `dom.bridge()` when the host wants to touch the DOM itself. There is no `beforeParse` hook: prepend a `<script>` to the HTML, or `eval()` your setup into the page after `createDOM()` and let `settle()` carry it into the page's pending work.

**Command line**: `npx wasm-quickjs-dom <URL | file | ->` prints the HTML after the scripts ran (`-e` prints a value, `--json` adds the logs, `--wait` / `--settle` / `--timeout`, and the limits `--block-private` / `--allow-host` / `--skip` ...). `--help` lists everything.

**Speed**: with the QuickJS engine `settleMs` is an upper bound. With no timer pending that falls due within it and no request in flight the page can no longer change, so it finishes without using up the time. External `<script src>`s are requested all at once and only run in document order. `skip: (url) => boolean` fails the URLs a render does not need (analytics, ads, ...) without going to the network (a `<script>` gets its `error` event, a `fetch` rejects). On real sites these three take most of the time off.

**Fetch limits (`limits`)**: for pages you do not control, restrict where the page's scripts may fetch from. It covers the page's own `fetch` / `XMLHttpRequest`, the `<script>`s and modules it loads, and the page itself given as `url`.

```ts
const dom = await createDOM({ url }, {
  limits: {
    allowedProtocols: ["https:"],
    allowedHosts: ["example.com", "cdn.example.com"], // exact match
    blockPrivateHosts: true,     // refuse localhost and private, loopback and link-local addresses
    maxResourceCount: 50,
    maxResourceBytes: 5_000_000,
    maxTotalResourceBytes: 20_000_000,
  },
});
```

- The names are those of the `limits` of `render()`. With `applyJavaScript()` the `limits` of the same call are the defaults, and `javascript: { limits }` overrides them.
- With host or protocol limits, redirects are not followed automatically: each one is checked before it is followed. A runtime that hides the redirect target (a browser's `opaqueredirect`) cannot be checked, so the request is refused.
- `blockPrivateHosts` looks at hostnames and IP literals only. A hostname that resolves to an internal address through DNS cannot be told apart here: pair it with `allowedHosts` when the target is not trusted.

**What happened in the page (`logs`)**: `dom.logs` keeps the `console` output, script errors, unhandled promise rejections (`unhandledrejection`) and the page's requests with their status or the reason they failed (the last 1000). The `onLog` option delivers them as they happen. Use them to find out why a page rendered empty.

```ts
const dom = await createDOM({ url }, { onLog: (e) => e.type === "error" && console.error(e.source, e.message) });
console.log(dom.logs.filter((e) => e.type === "request" && (e.error || (e.status ?? 0) >= 400)));
```

**Giving the page a layout (`measureLayout`)**: there is no layout inside QuickJS, so `getBoundingClientRect()` returns 0. `measureLayout()` lays the page out with the image engine (nothing is drawn or encoded) and hands the numbers to the page. Afterwards `getBoundingClientRect()`, `getClientRects()`, `offsetWidth` / `offsetHeight` / `offsetLeft` / `offsetTop`, `clientWidth` / `clientHeight` and `scrollWidth` / `scrollHeight` answer with the measured values.

```ts
import { createDOM, measureLayout } from "wasm-html-to-image/javascript";
import { render } from "wasm-html-to-image/workerd";

const dom = await createDOM({ url: "https://example.com/" }, { width: 1200 });
await measureLayout(dom, render, { width: 1200 });  // the render of the entry you use
const h = await dom.eval("document.querySelector('main').getBoundingClientRect().height");
```

- The values are a snapshot: call `measureLayout()` again after the page changed.
- An inline element in a line of text (`<span>`, `<a>`, ...) gets the one box that encloses all the line fragments it is broken into. The offsets are measured from the top left of the page, not from an `offsetParent`.
- The page itself is not touched: the marks for the layout are only on a copy.

**Following the page's changes (`enableLiveLayout`)**: when the page's scripts change the DOM and read `getBoundingClientRect()` or `getComputedStyle()` as they go, use `enableLiveLayout()` instead of the `measureLayout()` snapshot: every read is answered from the image engine's layout of the page as it is at that moment. The engine keeps the laid-out document and applies only what the page changed (attributes, `style`, text, inserted / removed / moved nodes).

```ts
import { createDOM, enableLiveLayout } from "wasm-html-to-image/javascript";
import { getDefaultModule } from "wasm-html-to-image/workerd"; // Node.js: loadHtmlToImageModule()

const dom = await createDOM({ url: "https://example.com/" }, { width: 1200 });
const layout = await enableLiveLayout(dom, await getDefaultModule(), { width: 1200, maxElements: 10000 });
await dom.eval("document.querySelector('main').style.height = '400px'");
await dom.eval("document.querySelector('footer').getBoundingClientRect().y"); // already moved
await layout.refreshResources(); // fetch the images, style sheets and fonts a script added
layout.dispose();
dom.close();
```

- Reads are synchronous and cannot fetch. Style sheets, fonts and images are fetched once, from the page as it is when you call `enableLiveLayout()`; what a script adds later is fetched by `await layout.refreshResources()` (until then an added image lays out as empty).
- Cost of one change plus one read (Node.js, 6,000 elements): a paint-only change (`color`, ...) about 13 ms, `append` about 90 ms, a change that moves boxes (`height`) about 170 ms; it grows with the number of elements. Tables are slower: about 0.6 s per change at 1,500 rows.
- On Cloudflare Workers (128 MB for both wasm modules) about 13,000 elements fit; keep `maxElements` at **10,000 or less**. A page over it, or an engine failure, leaves the boxes at 0 with one warning and the page keeps running. It needs the compatibility flag `enable_weak_ref`, and the gzipped upload (about 5.5 MB) needs a paid plan.
- Design and measurements: `doc/design/live-layout-incremental.md`; benchmark: `packages/html-to-image/scripts/bench-live-layout.mjs`.

### Rendering untrusted HTML (`limits`)

When rendering user-supplied HTML, always restrict where it may fetch from and how much. By default any host is fetched, and on Node local files under `baseUrl` are read.

| `limits` key            | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                |

| `strictFonts`           | `boolean`  | Throw `LIMIT_RESOURCE_COUNT` instead of rendering missing glyphs when fonts were skipped by `maxResourceCount` (default `false`) |

| `maxTotalResourceBytes` | `number`   | Maximum total bytes for all resources                                                                                                                                      |
| `allowedProtocols`      | `string[]` | Allowed URL protocols (e.g. `["https:"]`)                                                                                                                                  |

| `blockedHosts`          | `string[]` | Blocked hostnames                                                                                                                                                          |
| `blockPrivateHosts`     | `boolean`  | Block `localhost`, loopback, private IPv4/IPv6, link-local (`169.254.0.0/16`, etc.), and `.local`/`.internal` hostnames, including redirect targets (SSRF protection)     |
| `confineFilesToBaseUrl` | `boolean`  | **Opt-in (Node only).** Restrict local file reads to files inside `baseUrl` (symlinks resolved). `../` escapes are refused, and with no `baseUrl` no local file is read at all |

```ts
await render({
  value: untrustedHtml,
  width: 1200,
  baseUrl: "/srv/assets",
  limits: {
    timeoutMs: 10_000,
    maxResourceCount: 20,
    maxTotalResourceBytes: 10_000_000,
    allowedProtocols: ["https:"],
    confineFilesToBaseUrl: true,
  },
});
