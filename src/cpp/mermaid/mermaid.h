// no CSS variables, no <marker>), so the same SVG renders on every output path (PNG, PDF, SVG).
// Standard library only, so the layout can be unit tested on the host.
//
// Supported: flowchart / graph. (state, sequence, class, ER and xychart follow the same shape: a parser,
// a layout and an SVG writer behind render().)
